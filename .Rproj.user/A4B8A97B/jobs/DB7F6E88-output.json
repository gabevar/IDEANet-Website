Available options are\n          `frequency` and `distance`.\n\ndirected: A logical value indicating whether edges should be treated as\n          a directed or undirected when constructing the network.\n\nnet_name: A character value indicating the name to which network/igraph\n          objects should be given.\n\n   shiny: A logical value indicating whether `netwrite` is being used\n          in conjunction with IDEANet's Shiny-based visualization app.\n          Should be set to its default (`FALSE`) when not being used\n          with the Shiny app.\n\n  output: A character vector indicating the kinds of objects `netwrite`\n          should assign to the global environment. `netwrite` produces\n          several outputs that may not all be necessary to a user's\n          needs. Users can specify which outputs they specifically want\n          in order to minimize the number of objects appearing in the\n          global environment. Potential outputs include igraph\n          object(s) (`\"graph\"`), subgraph(s) of only nodes that appear\n          in the largest component and/or bicomponent of the network\n          (`\"largest_component\"`, `\"largest_bi_component\"`), data\n          frame(s) containing node-level measures\n          (`\"node_measure_plot\"`), a processed edgelist of the network\n          (`\"edgelist\"`), a data frame indicating network-level\n          summaries (`\"system_level_measures\"`), and summary\n          visualizations for node- and network-level measures\n          (`\"node_measure_plot\"`, `\"system_measure_plot\"`).\n\n message: A logical value indicating whether warning messages should be\n          displayed in the R console during processing.\n\n_\bV_\ba_\bl_\bu_\be:\n\n     `netwrite` returns a variety of outputs and assigns them to the R\n     global environment. Depending on the values assigned to the\n     `output` argument, `netwrite` will produce any or all of the\n     following:\n\n     If `output` contains `graph`, `netwrite` will return an igraph\n     object of the network represented in the original data. If a\n     vector is entered into the `type` argument, `netwrite` also\n     produces a list containing igraph objects for each unique relation\n     type as well as the overall network. These output objects are\n     named according to the value specified in the `net_name` argument.\n\n     If `output` contains `nodelist`, `netwrite` will return a\n     dataframe containing individual-level information for each node in\n     the network. This dataframe contains a set of frequently used\n     node-level measures for each node in the network. If a vector is\n     entered into the `type` argument, `netwrite` will produce these\n     node-level measures for each unique relattion type.\n\n     If `output` contains `edgelist`, `netwrite` will return a\n     formatted edgelist for the network represented in the original\n     data. If a vector is entered into the `type` argument, `netwrite`\n     also produces a list containing edgelists for each unique relation\n     type as well as the overall network.\n\n     If `output` contains `system_level_measures`, `netwrite` will\n     return a data frame providing network-level summary information.\n\n     If `output` contains `node_measure_plot`, `netwrite` will return a\n     plot summarizing the distribution of frequently used node-level\n     measures across all nodes in the network. If a vector is entered\n     into the `type` argument, `netwrite` also produces a list\n     containing node-level summary plots for each unique relation type\n     as well as the overall network.\n\n     If `output` contains `system_measure_plot`, `netwrite` will return\n     a plot summarizing the distribution of frequently used\n     network-level measures. If a vector is entered into the `type`\n     argument, `netwrite` also produces a list containing network-level\n     summary plots for each unique relation type as well as the overall\n     network.\n\n     If `output` contains `largest_bi_component`, `netwrite` will\n     return an igraph object of the largest bicomponent in the network\n     represented in the original data. If a vector is entered into the\n     `type` argument, `netwrite` also produces a list containing the\n     largest bicomponent for each unique relation type as well as the\n     overall network.\n\n     If `output` contains `largest_bi_component`, `netwrite` will\n     return an igraph object of the largest main component in the\n     network represented in the original data. If a vector is entered\n     into the `type` argument, `netwrite` also produces a list\n     containing the largest main component for each unique relation\n     type as well as the overall network.\n\n_\bE_\bx_\ba_\bm_\bp_\bl_\be_\bs:\n\n     # Use netwrite on an edgelist\n     netwrite(nodelist = fauxmesa_nodes,\n             node_id = \"id\",\n             i_elements = fauxmesa_edges$from,\n             j_elements = fauxmesa_edges$to,\n             directed = TRUE,\n             net_name = \"faux_mesa\")\n     \n     ### Inspect updated edgelist\n     head(edgelist)\n     \n     ### Inspect data frame of node-level measures\n     head(node_measures)\n     \n     ### Inspect system-level summary\n     system_level_measures\n     \n     ### Plot sociogram of network\n     plot(faux_mesa)\n     \n     ### View node-level summary visualization\n     node_measure_plot\n     \n     ### View system-level summary visualization\n     system_measure_plot\n     \n     \n     \n     # Run netwrite on an adjacency matrix\n     fauxmesa_adjmat <- as.matrix(igraph::as_adjacency_matrix(faux_mesa))\n     \n     netwrite(data_type = \"adjacency_matrix\",\n             adjacency_matrix = fauxmesa_adjmat,\n             directed = TRUE,\n             net_name = \"faux_mesa\")\n     \n     \n     # Run netwrite on a multirelational network\n     netwrite(i_elements = florentine$node,\n             j_elements = florentine$target,\n             type = florentine$layer,\n             directed = TRUE,\n             net_name = \"florentine\")\n     \n     # View system level summary for aggregate network\n     system_level_measures_list$summary_graph\n     \n     # View system level summary for network of `type 1` relations\n     system_level_measures_list$`1`\n     \n\n9/29                   \n10/29 [unnamed-chunk-5] \n"]
